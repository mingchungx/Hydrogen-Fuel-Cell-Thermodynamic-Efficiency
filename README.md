# Hydrogen-Fuel-Cell-Thermodynamic-Efficiency

##### Built with: Python, matplotlib and NumPy

This is a research paper that uses a Van't Hoff Plot as a method of calculating thermodynamic efficiency of an LHV hydrogen fuel cell. See the pdf for the full paper.

The code generates a Van't Hoff Plot based on thermodynamic data taken from The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, the Chemistry data booklet, the NIST-JANAF Thermodynamics Tables, and the CODATA Key Values for Thermodynamics.
